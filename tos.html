      <h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
      <p>By inviting or using JoinSpy in your Discord server, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the bot.</p>

      <h3>Bot Functionality</h3>
      <p>JoinSpy monitors new member joins, tracks invite usage, evaluates reputation scores, and provides moderation tools including global reputation lookup and watchlist notifications. The bot is provided as-is with no guarantee of uptime, accuracy, or reliability.</p>

      <h3>Prohibited Use</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not use JoinSpy to harass, abuse, or violate others’ rights.</li>
        <li>Automated or excessive command use (spamming) is prohibited.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineering, modification, or resale of JoinSpy is strictly forbidden.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>JoinSpy and its developer(s) are not liable for damages or losses arising from the use or inability to use the bot, including data loss, server disruption, or moderation errors.</p>

      <h3>Termination</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to remove JoinSpy or restrict access without notice for any violation of these Terms or at Discord’s request.</p>

      <h3>Modifications</h3>

      </ul>

      <h3>How We Use Data</h3>
      <p>Collected data is used solely for providing JoinSpy features: suspicious join detection, invite tracking, and reputation scoring. We do not sell or share user data with third parties.</p>

      <h3>Data Storage & Retention</h3>
      <p>Data is securely stored and may be retained indefinitely unless a server removes the bot or a user requests data deletion as described below.</p>

      <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
      <p>We do not share personal data. However, we will comply with requests from Discord Trust & Safety or law enforcement where legally required.</p>

      <h3>User Rights & Data Deletion</h3>
      <p>To request deletion of your data, contact the bot owner at <strong>.netd</strong> on Discord. Verified requests will be processed within 30 days.</p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>We implement security measures to protect stored data. However, no online system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h3>Compliance</h3>
      <p>JoinSpy complies with Discord Developer Terms and Community Guidelines. Usage of JoinSpy must also comply with Discord’s terms.</p>
