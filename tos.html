      <h3>Bot Functionality</h3>
      <p>JoinSpy monitors and logs new member joins, tracks invite usage, evaluates reputation scores based on account age, and provides moderation tools such as global reputation lookup, suspicious join alerts, and watchlist notifications. The bot is provided as-is with no guarantee of uptime, accuracy, or reliability.</p>

        <li>You may not use JoinSpy to harass, abuse, or violate the rights of other Discord users.</li>
        <li>Automated or unauthorized use, including spamming commands, is prohibited.</li>
        <li>You agree not to attempt to reverse engineer, modify, or resell JoinSpy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>JoinSpy and its developer(s) are not liable for any damages or losses arising from use or inability to use the bot, including but not limited to data loss, server disruption, or moderation errors.</p>

      <h3>Termination</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to remove JoinSpy from any server, restrict functionality, or terminate access without prior notice if these Terms are violated or if Discord requests removal.</p>

      <h3>Modifications</h3>
      <p>We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of JoinSpy indicates your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

      <h3>Data Storage & Retention</h3>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>We use secure storage practices to protect data from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no online system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h3>Compliance</h3>
      <p>JoinSpy is designed to comply with Discordâ€™s Developer Terms of Service and Community Guidelines. Use of JoinSpy must also comply with these Discord terms.</p>
